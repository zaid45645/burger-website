                United States was the first country to create the "hamburger" which is also known as a "burger",
                where two slices of bread and a ground beef patty were combined together into a "hamburger" and sold as
                such. There is still a lot of controversy over the origin of the hamburger - mainly because it is just 
                two ingredients, bread and beef. However after various controversies, the burger is now readily identified 
                with the United States, as well as a particular style of American cuisine, namely fast food.

                The hamburger's international popularity is the result of the larger globalization of food that also includes
                the rise in global popularity of other national dishes, including the italian pizza, fried rice, and also 
                sushi! :3.  The hamburger has spread from continent to continent, perhaps also because it matches familiar 
                elements in different culinary cultures. It was popularised and refined by McDonals's in the 1940's.

                Minced meat was a delicacy in medieval cuisine, red meat being usually restricted to higher classes. Very little
                mincing was done by meideival butchers or recorded in the cookbooks as because it was not part  of the sausage-making
                process that preserves meat. During the 19th century, most european emigrants to the New World embarked from Hamburg, 
                Germany, and New York City was their most common destination. Restaurants in New York offered Hamburg-style American Fillet,
                or even beefsteak. Early American preparations of minced beef were therefore made to fit the style

                This was already a very big advancement in the making of the "hamburger". The other spark/critical step in the burger's evolution
                was making it a convient and handheld meal for giffy quick hunger cravings. There are several people who are competing for the claim
                of putting that PATTY in between that BREAD. Some of those guys could include, The Menches Brothers, Oscar Weber Bilby and even
                Louis Lassen.

                The Menches Brothers claimed that they apparently ran out of pork at a fair and decided to substitue ground beef. While Oscar Bilby claims that 
                his family was the first to ever serve a cooked ground-beef patty on an actual yeast bun. And lastly Louis claimed to have created a quick meal
                by grilling ground beef and placing them between two slices of toast for a huried customer. And the list goes on and on, that is why we still can't 
                determine the true owner to the recipe of the "burger".

                Here is how to make one if you got hungry reading this:<br>
                <br>
                1. Get ground beef and form it gently into a patty and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.<br><br> 
                2. Heat a pan over medium heat with a little butter. Cook THAT PATTY for approx 3 to 5 min per side.<br><br>
                3. If you want to add cheese, then place a slice on top of the patty during the last minute of cooking.<br><br>
                4. Remove the patty and place it on a plate. While it rests, lightly cut your buns and toast them.<br><br>
                5. Spread your fav condiments on the bun such as ketchup. Place your patty on the bottom bun followed by onions and tomatoes, then cap it with the top buns and eat (NOMNOM :3)
